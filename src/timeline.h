//! reader's current article (body + header) in place and mark it dirty, so

//! (FullSummary reply to a proto_request_summary fetch). Chunks are handed
//! through straight from the inbox buffer — NOT copied — so this hook must
//! copy `text` into its own heap buffer before returning. `last` marks the
//! final chunk; once it arrives the assembled full text replaces the
//! 140-char preview in the scrollable body. A ("", true) call (SummaryLast
//! alone) closes an empty/errored fetch and keeps the preview. `id` is the
//! article id the phone put on the chunk ("" when absent): a chunk whose id
//! does not match the settled article is dropped (stale pipe protection).
//! No-op when no reader is open or the chunks are stale (the reader moved
//! on).
