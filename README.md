# HeadeRSS

FreshRSS feed headings on your Pebble Time 2 — browse the feed tree, run
through articles, mark them read, star favourites. Native Timeline-style
reading view with a black top bar, editorial headings and an accent sidebar
(clock, unread dot, star, match badge).

> ☕ **Buy Me A Coffee** — These are small tools, built with AI — on purpose. There isn't enough time to learn every language and dive into every rabbit hole, so AI lets me solve real problems from my daily life and homelab — and that matters more to me than clever code.
> The AI writes most of the code; the idea, the tinkering, testing, publishing and maintenance are mine.
> Issues answered, features shipped, a few stars and downloads — does that sound like AI slop? Take a look and make your own opinion.

## Features

- **Feed tree** — All unread / Starred / **Important** (FreshRSS priority
  feeds) streams, nested folders with unread badges, feeds sorted by newest
  activity; open a folder to play **all articles recursively** or dive into
  a single feed

  ![Feed tree](resources/store/menu.png)

- **Timeline reading view** — one article full screen: 2 px accent progress
  line at the very top, black top bar with the stream name in accent,
  editorial header (GOTHIC_24_BOLD heading in the theme color on the page
  background, accent feed·time line, 2 px accent rule), full summary body —
  fetched on demand (the phone streams the complete text, chunked) so
  nothing is ever shortened; the full-height accent sidebar holds a clock
  at the top, the unread dot (white = unread), the star (outlined yellow =
  favourited) and the M badge (alarm-red when highlight words match)

  ![Article](resources/store/article.png)
- **Read through** — opening a stream shows the first article; DOWN always
  skips to the next; long articles show a centered "HOLD ▼: Scroll" hint —
  holding enters scroll mode, where taps page-scroll (~3/4 viewport), a
  hold jumps to the next article at any time and the hint reads
  "HOLD ▼: Next"; UP mirrors DOWN (previous article in the skim view,
  scroll-up inside scroll mode, back to the skim view at the top);
  **SELECT toggles read/unread** (and cancels the auto-mark timer),
  long-press SELECT stars; articles are marked read after being shown for
  the configured time (see Auto mark read)
- **Touch** (Time 2 class watches, on by default) — menus: swipe scrolls,
  tap selects, a swipe up on the top entry opens the sub-menu; reader:
  swipe up/down jumps between articles, tap toggles read/unread,
  press-and-hold stars, double tap enters article scroll — drag to read,
  double tap again (or a swipe up at the top) gets back; a swipe down at
  the article bottom moves on. Switch off in the phone settings if
  firmware touch bugs bite
- **Unread only** — watch toggle (sub-menu): hides read articles from the
  server for feed/folder streams; "All unread" always shows only unread
- **Star** — long-press SELECT toggles the star; starred articles show a
  yellow star in the sidebar
- **Word highlighting** — set up to 10 words/phrases in the phone settings;
  matches are accent + bold + underlined in the summary and accent-filled
  chips with black text in the heading (whole words, case-insensitive,
  hyphens count as boundaries); updates live while reading; the sidebar's M
  badge lights up on articles with matches

  ![Highlight matches](resources/store/article_match.png)

- **Per-feed actions** — long-press SELECT on a feed row: **Mark all read**
  (with confirm) or **Refresh** (re-fetch and open at the newest)
- **Modern look** — dark theme by default, accent color everywhere: black
  top strip with accent dots on the root menu, permanent accent right spine
  in every menu, unread counts as filled accent pills, accent-selected rows;
  reader = 2 px accent progress line at the very top, black top bar with
  accent stream name, editorial headings (theme color, accent feed·time +
  rule), accent sidebar (clock / unread dot / star / M); light theme
  selectable from the phone settings or the watch's Theme row
- **Settings** — UP on the top black strip opens the watch sub-menu:
  Refresh, Mark all read, **Auto mark read** (Never / Immediately / 1s /
  2s / 3s / 5s / 10s), Unread only, **Theme** (System / Dark / Light),
  Important row / Progress line toggles; the connection/appearance page
  lives in the phone app settings (Clay): FreshRSS URL, username, API
  password, accent color, touch, highlight words

  ![Sub-menu](resources/store/menu_2.png)

- **Lean** — bounded article window in RAM (68 on the Time 2, 56 on the
  64 KB class), live-only data, tree cached in flash for instant start

## API

100% FreshRSS-compatible via the **GReader API** (`/api/greader.php`):
ClientLogin auth (per-user **API password**, not the login password),
subscription list, unread counts, continuation-paginated streams, edit-tag
mark-read/star, mark-all-as-read, user-info.

## Setup

1. Install the app on your watch.
2. In the Pebble app -> HeadeRSS settings: enter your FreshRSS URL
   (e.g. `http://192.168.178.55:8080`), username and **API password**
   (FreshRSS profile -> API password — a separate password, min. 7 chars).
3. Open the app: the feed tree loads; UP on the top row opens the sub-menu.

## Build

Requires the Pebble SDK (v4.17+ for touch support):

```bash
pebble build
```

## Credits

- Inspired by [pebble-ha-launcher](https://github.com/SHU-red/pebble-ha-launcher)
  (architecture, menus, dialogs, Clay config, chunked AppMessage streaming)
- Native Timeline look recreated with the Pebble SDK's MenuLayer, GPath and
  Animation APIs
